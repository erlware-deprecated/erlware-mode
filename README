Deprecation Notice
==================

The Erlware Emacs Mode is deprecated. All significant changes
made to the Erlware version have been incorporated into the
latest release of the official distribution.

Future development of the Emacs mode for Erlang should proceed
with the official version at:

  http://github.com/erlang/otp


User configuration notes
========================

Below is a quick guide to necessary configurations for getting
started with the Erlang mode for Emacs. Please refer to the
Users guide and reference manual in the documentation for the
Erlang/OTP application tools for more information.

You can obtain a copy of the Erlang man pages here:

    http://www.erlang.org/download

Note for the man page menus to be populated, the Erlang
man pages must be in uncompressed form.

Additional documenation for this mode can be found here:

For UNIX users
--------------

To set up the Erlang Emacs mode on UNIX systems, edit/create the file
.emacs in the your home directory.

Below is a complete example of what should be added to a user's .emacs
provided that OTP is installed in the directory /usr/local/otp:
        
      (setq load-path (cons "<path-to-mode>/erlware-mode" load-path))
      (setq erlang-man-root-dir "/usr/local/otp")
      (setq exec-path (cons "/usr/local/otp/bin" exec-path))
      (require 'erlang-start)

For XEmacs, you use add-to-list to modify the load path:

      (add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-mode>/erlware-mode")

If your XEmacs system already has the default erlang mode on
the search path, you may need to put the erlware path at the
front of the search path:

      (push "<path-to-mode>/erlware-mode" load-path)


For Windows users
-----------------

To set up the Erlang Emacs mode on Windows systems, edit/create the
file .emacs, the location of the file depends on the configuration of
the system. If the HOME environment variable is set, Emacs will look
for the .emacs file in the directory indicated by the HOME variable.
 If HOME is not set, Emacs will look for the .emacs file in C:\.

Below is a complete example of what should be added to a user's .emacs
provided that OTP is installed in the directory C:\Program
Files\erl-<Ver>:

      (setq load-path (cons  "<path-to-mode>/erlware-mode" load-path))
      (setq erlang-man-root-dir "C:/Program Files/erl<Ver>")
      (setq exec-path (cons "C:/Program Files/erl<Ver>/bin" exec-path))
      (require 'erlang-start)

For XEmacs, you use add-to-list to modify the load path:

      (add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-mode>/erlware-mode")

If your XEmacs system already has the default erlang mode on
the search path, you may need to put the erlware path at the
front of the search path:

      (push "<path-to-mode>/erlware-mode" load-path)
